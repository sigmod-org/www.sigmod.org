# Content cleanup list

This is the running list of pages that are duplicated, overlapping, empty or
outdated. Update the **Status** column as decisions are made.

**Where things stand (November 2026):** the exact duplicates (§1) are handled; the
Anthology, DiSC and Distinguished Profiles pages moved to the
[SIGMOD Archive](https://archive.sigmod.org/) (§2, §5); the yearly calls for nominations were replaced
by the Ongoing Call-for-Awards page (§2); the Membership page was reviewed (§5).
Still open, in suggested order: the three Publications pages and the
dissertation pages (§2), the empty parent pages (§3), and the award data files
(§4, §6). Larger plans are in [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md#next-steps).

Rules:

- **Never break a URL.** "Remove" means the page becomes a redirect stub
  (`redirect_to:` in its front matter) pointing to the page that replaces it.
  Delete a page outright only if nothing should replace it. Even then, prefer
  a redirect to the nearest parent page.
- To mark a page as merged, set `redirect_to: /target/` in its
  `src/content/.../index.md` and copy any unique content into the target first.

Statuses: **done** (handled in the repo) · **proposed** (ready, needs a yes) ·
**decide** (needs a decision from the EC or editors) · **keep**.

## 1. Exact duplicates (automatic redirects)

The importer finds these itself (≥94% identical text) and turns the copy into
a redirect. They are re-detected on every `npm run import`. The current list is
in `migration/duplicates.json`.

The posts below are still listed on `/news/`, but their links go to the
canonical page.

Status: **done**. Spot-check a few before going live.

## 2. Near-duplicates to merge (manual)

These pages overlap heavily, but each has some unique text. Merge the content
into the kept page by hand, then redirect the other one.

| Pages | What's going on | Proposal | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/publications/anthology/` · `/publications/anthologyhome/` | 89% the same text. `anthologyhome` was edited later (2019). | The Anthology moved to the SIGMOD Archive with the `anthologyhome` tables (the better version); both URLs redirect to https://archive.sigmod.org/publications/anthology/. | done |
| `/publications/` · `/publications/publications/` · `/publication-list/` | Three "Publications" pages. `/publications/` has dead links (`portal.acm.org`, pubzone.org, the Michigan digital review). `/publication-list/` is the current short list. `/publications/publications/` is what the menu links to. | Keep `/publications/publications/` as the hub and merge the `/publication-list/` items into it. Redirect the other two. | proposed |
| `/publications/` · `/archive/` | Both list the old archives (DiSC, Anthology, Profiles). | `/archive/` (History › Archive) now links to the SIGMOD Archive. Keep it; drop the archive list from `/publications/` when the Publications pages are merged. | proposed |
| `/sigmod-awards/` · `/sigmod-awards/sigmod-awards-acm-sigmod-official-website/` | The second page is a 20 KB old all-awards overview, copied from the pre-2015 site. Its relative links are broken. | Removed entirely (no redirect). Listed in `migration/removed.json` so the importer does not bring it back. | done |
| `/sigmod-awards/sigmod-jim-gray-doctoral-dissertation-award/` · `/sigmod-awards/doctoral-dissertation-award/` · `/sigmod-awards/2017-doctoral-dissertation-award/` · `/sigmod-awards/the-sigmod-jim-gray-doctoral-dissertation-award/` | 4 pages: the award page, the current call, and process descriptions from 2015 and 2017 (59–75% the same). | One award page with sections for "How to nominate" and "Process". Redirect the 2015 and 2017 process pages. Keep the call as a section or a stub. | proposed |
| `/sigmod-awards/sigmod-undergraduate-award/` | 82% of its text is also in the old overview page above. Last edited 2017. | Merged with the Student Research Competition into `/sigmod-history/past-awards/student-research-and-undergraduate/` under History › Past awards; both old URLs redirect there. | done |
| `/sigmod-awards/people/jeffrey-d-ullman-2006/` · `/sigmod-awards/people/jeffrey-ullman/` | One person, two awards (2006 Innovations, 1996 Contributions). Not a duplicate. | Keep both. Listed here only because of a past mix-up (see §1 #2). | keep |
| `/sigmod-awards/people/laura-haas/` · `/laura-haas-contributions/` · `/michael-carey/` · `/michael-carey-contributions/` · `/surajit-chaudhuri/` · `/surajit-chaudhuri-innovations/` | Recipients of two awards each. Slugs are inconsistent. | Keep. Future pages follow one slug pattern (§4). `/michael-carey-contributions/` says "Information missing!", so fill it in or redirect it to the Contributions award page. | decide |
| `/sigmod-awards/citations/2004-…-test-of-time-award` · `…-2` (also 2006 and `…-2`) | Two different winning papers in the same year. Not duplicates, but the `-2` slugs are WordPress artifacts. | Keep the URLs. On the Test-of-Time page, list both papers under the year. | keep |
| `/sigmods-position-on-racism/` · `/sigmod-executive-committee-position-on-racism/` | Two different statements (the 2020 joint statement, and the EC position with DBCares). | Keep both, but group them under Policies with a short intro. | proposed |
| `/call-for-nominations-2022-acm-sigmod-awards/` (page) and calls 2016–2021 (posts) | 74–92% the same text every year. | Replaced by the standing [Ongoing Call-for-Awards](/sigmod-awards/ongoing-awards-call/) page (continuous nominations, February 1 cut-off). Keep the old calls as news; redirect the 2022 page to the ongoing call. | proposed (redirect) |
| `/2025-sigmod-awards/`, `/2024-…`, `/2023-…`, `/2022-sigmod-awards/` (posts) vs the per-award tables | Each yearly post repeats rows that are also in every award table. | Generate the yearly summary from award data. Keep the posts as short news items that link to the award pages. | decide |

## 3. Empty, placeholder or broken pages

| Page | Content | Proposal | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/2061-2/` | Untitled. Only leftover page-builder shortcodes (`[vc_row]…`). | Redirect to `/`. | proposed |
| `/about-sigmod/sponsorship/` | Empty parent page. | Redirect to `/about-sigmod/sponsorship/sponsorship-of-meetings/`. | proposed |
| `/sigmod-awards/people/` | Empty parent page. | Redirect to `/sigmod-awards/`. | proposed |
| `/sigmod-awards/citations/` | Empty parent page. | Redirect to `/sigmod-awards/`. | proposed |
| `/sigmod-awards/committees/` | Empty parent page. | Redirect to `/sigmod-awards/committees/sigmod-awards-committee/`. | proposed |
| `/software/pdf/` · `/software/pdf/sigmod-freedb-letter-pdf/` | Empty parent page, and an attachment page for a 6 KB PDF. | Removed with the rest of `/software/`. | done |
| `/sigmod-awards/people/michael-carey-contributions/` | "Information missing!" | Fill in the citation or redirect it (see §2). | decide |
| `/sigmod-history/sigmod-logo-history/` · `/about-sigmod/sigmod-logo-renderings/` | History, renderings and usage of the logo. | Merged the other way: the logo history page holds everything, and the renderings page redirects to its `#using-the-logo` section. | done |
| `/sigmod-awards/committees/systems-awards-committee/` | Last edited in 2019. The Systems Award is now chosen by the SIGMOD Awards Committee, as the award page says. | Redirect to the SIGMOD Awards Committee page. | decide |

## 4. Award pages with no consistent home

The 147 award pages are spread over:

- `/sigmod-awards/people/<name>[-year-award]/` (61, 2015–2020)
- `/sigmod-awards/citations/<year>-<award>/` (38, 2003–2021)
- the site root, e.g. `/2025-sigmod-systems-award/`,
  `/sigmod-2026-test-of-time-award/`, `/carlo-zaniolo-2025-…/` (29, 2021 onward)

Proposal (**decide**):

- Keep all existing URLs.
- From now on, put new recipient pages at
  `/sigmod-awards/<award>/<year>/` (e.g.
  `/sigmod-awards/sigmod-systems-award/2027/`). Generate them from
  `src/_data/awards/*.yml`, so that the award table, the citation page and the
  yearly news summary all come from one entry.
- Optionally, add new canonical addresses for the 29 root-level pages and turn
  the old addresses into redirects. This is only worth doing once the award
  data files exist.

## 5. Outdated content to archive or retire

| Pages | Notes | Proposal | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/publications/interview/*` (66 pages) + `/publications/interview/` | Each page had one link to a Flash video (`.flv`); the video and audio files (8.4 GB) were not online. | Moved to the [SIGMOD Archive](https://archive.sigmod.org/publications/interview/) at the same paths; old URLs redirect or are forwarded. The videos (converted to MP4) and audio are hosted on archive.sigmod.org under `/media/distinguished_profiles/`; each Profiles page plays them, and the listing is a searchable gallery. The old `/publications/interviews/{flv,mp3}/` addresses are not forwarded. | done |
| `/conferences/sigmod-1974/` … `/sigmod-2001/` (26) | Per-year proceedings pages. | Keep for now, linked from `/conferences/`. Later, fold them into the Conferences page as anchors (MIGRATION.md, next steps). | keep |
| `/software/`, `/software/commerical/`, `/software/nonprofit/`, `/software/index-of-publically-available-database-software/` | Software lists from 2015, no longer maintained. | Removed entirely (listed in `migration/removed.json`). `/freepublic-domain-software/` and the freedb letter PDF were removed too. | done |
| `/publications/sigmod-digital-symposium-collection/` | DiSC, ended 2011. | Moved to the [SIGMOD Archive](https://archive.sigmod.org/publications/discs/); this URL redirects there. | done |
| `/sigmod-history/sigmod-online/` | History of the website. | Keep under History. | keep |
| `/pods-home/pods-30th-anniversary-statistics/` | Last edited 2015. | Merge into `/pods-home/pods-30th-anniversary/`, then redirect. Ask the PODS EC. | decide |
| `/membership/` | Last edited 2018. | Reviewed November 2026: 2025 membership numbers, ACM's SIGMOD statistics link, current proceedings and PACMMOD links, student travel grants, all awards; outdated items removed. Re-check the numbers yearly. | done |

## 6. Content kept in two places (risk of inconsistency)

These are not duplicate pages, but the same facts are typed into several
places. Move each into one data file.

| Fact | Where it appears | Data file |
|---|---|---|
| Officers, EC, advisory boards (SIGMOD and PODS) | `/about-sigmod/`, `/pods-home/pods-organization/`, news posts about new officers | `src/_data/people.yml` |
| Conference list | `/conferences/`, home page, PODS organization table | `src/_data/conferences.json` (exists) |
| Award winners | per-award tables, recipient pages, yearly award posts, home page | `src/_data/awards/*.yml` |
| PODS awards | `/pods-home/pods-best-paper-awards/`, `/pods-home/acm-pods-alberto-o-mendelzon-test-of-time-award/`, SIGMOD news posts (`/pods-2020-best-paper-award/`, `/2020-pods-alberto-mendelzon-test-of-time-award/`) | `src/_data/awards/pods-*.yml` |

## 7. Link health

Broken links are tracked by the link reports (MIGRATION.md, *Link health*).
Open items as of November 2026:

| What | Where | Proposal | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 7 links to upload images missing since the old site (Jim Gray dissertation honorable mentions 2013–2015, Jennifer Widom's 2015 portrait) | award citation pages, Widom news item | Find a copy (Wayback, the people themselves) or drop the images | decide |
| Old conference websites that no longer exist (2000, 2002–2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2021) | `/conferences/`, Best Paper page | Link the mirror.sigmod.org copy or a Wayback copy instead | proposed |
| Moved personal and tutorial pages (Miller, Freire, Milo, Arenas, Tick, Hull, Egenhofer, Martens) | dissertation award, PODS pages | Update to current addresses or drop | proposed |
| Dead services (pubzone.org, the Michigan digital review) | `/publications/` | Drop with the Publications merge | proposed |
